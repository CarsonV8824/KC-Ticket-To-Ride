  <h1>About KC Ticket to Ride Lite</h1>
  <p>This game was based off of Ticket to Ride, a popular board game where players collect train cards to claim railway routes across a map. The goal is to complete destination tickets and earn the most points by the end of the game.</p>
  
  <h2>How to Play</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Each player starts with a set number of train cards and destination tickets.</li>
    <li>On your turn, you can either draw train cards, or claim a route.</li>
    <li>Claiming routes requires you to have the appropriate number and color of train cards.</li>
    <li>The game ends when a player has two or fewer trains left, and final scores are calculated based on completed routes and tickets.</li>
    <li>The game should take 10-30 minutes to play because it's lite.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>Features still coming like destination cards and more detailed scoring.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Credits</h2>
  <p>This digital adaptation of Ticket to Ride was created by Carson V. The original board game was designed by Alan R. Moon and published by Days of Wonder.</p>
