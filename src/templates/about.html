  <h1>About Ticket to Ride</h1>
  <p>Ticket to Ride is a popular board game where players collect train cards to claim railway routes across a map. The goal is to complete destination tickets and earn the most points by the end of the game.</p>
  
  <h2>How to Play</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Each player starts with a set number of train cards and destination tickets.</li>
    <li>On your turn, you can either draw train cards, claim a route, or draw additional destination tickets.</li>
    <li>Claiming routes requires you to have the appropriate number and color of train cards.</li>
    <li>The game ends when a player has two or fewer trains left, and final scores are calculated based on completed routes and tickets.</li>
  </ul>
